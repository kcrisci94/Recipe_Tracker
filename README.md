# React Express Starter Pack

> Create full stack apps with React and Express. Run your client and server with a single command. 

## Quick Start

``` bash
# Install dependencies for server
npm install

# Install dependencies for client
npm run client-install

# Run the client & server with concurrently
npm run dev

# Run the Express server only
npm run server

# Run the React client only
npm run client

# Server runs on http://localhost:5000 and client on http://localhost:3000
```

## App Info
The init.sql file contains the testing data in order to see how the application works. 
Open mysql and run source init.sql

Both the client and the server dependencies must be installed (see above)
Once installed use:
npm run dev 
to start the application
